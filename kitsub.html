<p>A stage 3 modification is regarded by most as a track day modification.
    Like stage 2 mods they will also need other mods to support them but they are usually far from ideal for road use as we will explain. Take racing brakes for example. These can tolerate extremely high temperatures but they are pretty useless whilst cool. On the road you can't afford to have to wait for the brakes to warm up before they operate effectively. On the track they will run hot through each lap. An aggressive cam profile will also move the power band right up the rev range and cause a very lumpy tick over making the car hard to drive in day to day traffic.
    Heavy duty clutches can be off or on in their nature and make driving in slow traffic nearly impossible. A stage 3 race modified car will also need to be regularly overhauled and serviced.
    The extra strain put on the cars engine will result in premature engine wear and if a car is used on a daily basis it will become very unreliable.</p>
