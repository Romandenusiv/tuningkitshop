<p>A stage 1 modification can be added in isolation. This means that a true stage 1 modification part does not require any other engine modifications to get it to work.
    Whilst other mods can help to raise the power gains and realize the full potential of the mod they are not mandatory. These are at the bottom end of the tuning scene in terms of the overall benefits you will get.
     Stage 1 mods are generally a straightforward DIY fit and should work on a standard engine that is in good condition.
    Some examples of stage 1 mods include, induction kits, panel air filters, sports exhausts, fuel pressure regulators, a simple engine remap or timing changes, blow off valves/divertors  and the like.</p>
